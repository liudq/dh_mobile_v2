In the first place, the communication it is perfect.  The seller, whose name is Helen from ANYBRIDAL has perfect communication skills, very knowledgeable and patient.  Above all she is a professional in her job.  We did not hesitate to shop the gown the moment she began talking to us.  The delivery time? My oh my!  One month in advance!  We are more than reliefed  because we are not worried about the gown any more.  The fabric is so beautiful, high quality.  The gown fits my daughter perfectly!  We are stunned about every single detail.  The veil, the petticoat, the shoes, the hair accessories,I mean, everything is way beyond than what we can imagine.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND you to shop with ANYBRIDAL.  Helen will help you and you will get more than what you expect.\r\nThere were tears of happiness when we got the package, and is not the big day yet!  Imagine the big day! ",

I noticed all the positive reviews you had, and decided to take a risk. I asked Helen to add on extra beading and sleeves, and she went above and beyond with making this happen. I did pay extra for the add-ons. However, I am thrilled with how perfect it turned out ! It was worth every penny and more!!!! Thank you! Thank you! I RECOMMEND ALL FIRST TIME BUYERS TO PURCHASE FROM HELEN! She is patient, quick with communication, and helpful. ",

Perfect for any body size if you are thinking of handing this dress down the generation\r\n\r\nGOWN:\r\n1) The ruffles are exquisitely made. They look elegant especially for the price paid.\r\n2) Unfortunately there were some pen markings on the frills\r\n [the perfectionist side of me]\r\nbut was assured by seller i could wash it away with some water =)\r\n3) You MUST purchase the \"SLIP\" to have the POOFY LOOK!!\r\n\r\nCLEAR communication!\r\n\r\nI HIGHLY recommend this seller and this dress! =)\r\nSher, Malaysia",
